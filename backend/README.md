#Backend

##start
for dev purposes
`npm run devStart`

for prod purposes
`npm run start`

##functionality
The Backend automatically checks in the startup if the following entities exist:
- measurements
- countries
- cities

##db connection
The db connection needs a password. It is sent in the comment of the acn-code-now submission

##possible improvements
The api of thopenAQService is kinda instable and so slow, but when it's faster then there could be tests about if the import works fine
